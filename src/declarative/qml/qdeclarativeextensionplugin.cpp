    \class QDeclarativeExtensionPlugin
    \brief The QDeclarativeExtensionPlugin class provides an abstract base for custom QML extension plugins.

    \ingroup plugins

    QDeclarativeExtensionPlugin is a plugin interface that makes it
    possible to offer extensions that can be loaded dynamically into
    applications using the QDeclarativeEngine class.

    Writing a QML extension plugin is achieved by subclassing this
    base class, reimplementing the pure virtual registerTypes()
    function, and exporting the class using the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2()
    macro.

    QML extension plugins can be used to provide either application-specific or
    library-like plugins. Library plugins should limit themselves to registering types,
    as any manipulation of the engine's root context may cause conflicts
    or other issues in the library user's code.

    See \l {Extending QML in C++} for details how to write a QML extension plugin.
    See \l {How to Create Qt Plugins} for general Qt plugin documentation.

/*!
    \fn void QDeclarativeExtensionPlugin::registerTypes(const char *uri)

    Registers the QML types in the given \a uri. Here you call qmlRegisterType() for
    all types which are provided by the extension plugin.
*/

/*!
    Constructs a QML extension plugin with the given \a parent.

    Note that this constructor is invoked automatically by the
    Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro, so there is no need for calling it
    explicitly.

    Initializes the extension from the \a uri using the \a engine. Here an application
    plugin might, for example, expose some data or objects to QML,
    as context properties on the engine's root context.
