    \class QDeclarativeParserStatus
    \since 4.7
    \brief The QDeclarativeParserStatus class provides updates on the QML parser state.

    QDeclarativeParserStatus provides a mechanism for classes instantiated by
    a QDeclarativeEngine to receive notification at key points in their creation.

    This class is often used for optimization purposes, as it allows you to defer an
    expensive operation until after all the properties have been set on an
    object. For example, QML's \l {Text} element uses the parser status
    to defer text layout until all of its properties have been set (we
    don't want to layout when the \c text is assigned, and then relayout
    when the \c font is assigned, and relayout again when the \c width is assigned,
    and so on).

    To use QDeclarativeParserStatus, you must inherit both a QObject-derived class
    and QDeclarativeParserStatus, and use the Q_INTERFACES() macro.

    \code
    class MyObject : public QObject, public QDeclarativeParserStatus
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_INTERFACES(QDeclarativeParserStatus)

    public:
        MyObject(QObject *parent = 0);
        ...
        void classBegin();
        void componentComplete();
    }
    \endcode
