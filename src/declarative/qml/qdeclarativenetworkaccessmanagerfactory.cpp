    \class QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory
    \since 4.7
    \brief The QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory class provides a factory for QNetworkAccessManager for use by a Qt Declarative engine.

    QNetworkAccessManager is used for all network access by QML.
    By implementing a factory it is possible to create custom
    QNetworkAccessManager with specialized caching, proxy and
    cookie support.

    To implement a factory, subclass QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory and implement
    the create() method.

    To use a factory, assign it to the relevant QDeclarativeEngine using
    QDeclarativeEngine::setNetworkAccessManagerFactory().

    If the created QNetworkAccessManager becomes invalid, due to a
    change in proxy settings, for example, call the invalidate() method.
    This will cause all QNetworkAccessManagers to be recreated.

    Note: the create() method may be called by multiple threads, so ensure the
    implementation of this method is reentrant.

    \sa QDeclarativeEngine::setNetworkAccessManagerFactory()

/*!
  The destructor is empty.

QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory::~QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory()

/*!
    \fn QNetworkAccessManager *QDeclarativeNetworkAccessManagerFactory::create(QObject *parent)

    Implement this method to create a QNetworkAccessManager with \a parent.
    This allows proxies, caching and cookie support to be setup appropriately.

    This method should return a new QNetworkAccessManager each time it is called.

    Note: this method may be called by multiple threads, so ensure the
    implementation of this method is reentrant.
