\section1 Running the examples

You can find many simple examples in the \c examples/declarative
sub-directory that show how to use various aspects of QML. In addition, the
\c demos/declarative sub-directory contains more sophisticated demos of large
applications. These demos are intended to show integrated functionality
rather than being instructive on specific elements.

To run the examples and demos, you can use Qt Creator or the included \l {Qt Declarative UI Runtime}{qml}
command-line application. It has some useful options, revealed by:

\code
    bin/qml -help
\endcode

For example, from your build directory, run:

\code
    bin/qml $QTDIR/demos/declarative/samegame/samegame.qml
\endcode
