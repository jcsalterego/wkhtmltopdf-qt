    \title QML Reference

    \target qtdeclarativemainpage

    QML is a language for building the animation rich,
    highly fluid user interfaces that are becoming common in portable consumer
    electronics devices such as mobile phones, media players, set-top boxes and
    netbooks. It is also appropriate for highly custom desktop
    user interfaces, or special elements in more traditional desktop user interfaces.

    Building fluid applications is done declaratively, rather than procedurally.
    That is, you specify \e what the UI should look like and how it should behave
    rather than specifying step-by-step \e how to build it. Specifying a UI declaratively
    does not just include the layout of the interface items, but also the way each
    individual item looks and behaves and the overall flow of the application.

    The QML elements provide a sophisticated set of graphical and behavioral building
    blocks.  These different elements are combined together in \l {QML Documents}{QML documents} to build components
    ranging in complexity from simple buttons and sliders, to complete
    internet-enabled applications like a \l {http://www.flickr.com}{Flickr} photo browser.
